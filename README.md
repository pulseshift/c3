This is a fork of c3. Purpose of this project is to enhace c3 by some custom features and to be used as a dependency only in [ui5-lib-visualization](https://github.com/pulseshift/ui5-lib-visualization).

> c3 is a D3-based reusable chart library that enables deeper integration of charts into web applications.
